Unit tests validate one example at a time, but what if you didn't have to think up dozens of unique examples and write them by hand?

* 100 monkeys to drive your web application
* 10 million example transactions for load testing
* gain confidence in your software without writing hundreds of example scenarios.

* "thought tool" to identify useful properties to validate,
* ideas for testing some "tricky" properties, 
* an intuition for when to use generative testing vs. example-based unit tests.

* team-based gratitude tracker
	* design
	* validation of examples of generating "synthetic thank you notes" for testing, property testing the implementation,
	* model-based testing the awards system.

Examples in C# and Clojure.
