# Jeremy Sellars

My name is Jeremy Sellars.  I help businesses by showing how difficult and time-consuming tasks can be made simple, tractable, and cost-effective, then I help implement them with software.

# Introductions

I'd like to get to know eachother a bit over the next 50 minutes.  So, a short informal interview which you should feel free to participate in as much or as little as you desire.

# How many of us are in business?

Let us propose for a moment that a business is a group of people oriented around the idea of providing products or services or ideas that clients would value... value enough to voluntarily return "certificates of gratitude" as compensation.  Perhaps these certificates are covered with images of famous people like Benjamin Franklin or perhaps they say "pay to the order of _________________".  I'm getting at the notion that when we engage in business, the goals are mutually beneficial, at least at some level.

# How many of us are employees?

I don't think it is too much of a stretch to propose that we, as employees, provide our employer with products, services, research, labor, TPS reports, or ideas that they value, and that they compensate us for.

# How many of us are in "Information Technology?"

I used to kind of bristle if someone confused "programming" with "Information Technology."  Then I realized that much of programming is collecting facts, and writing an algorithm to interpret the facts to produce a desired result.  Sometimes the end-result is information (as in a database or a report).  Other times it is a systematic action taken on the information produced.

# Do you love data?

Since you all have come to a session about generating data and generative testing, I am going to assume many of you are involved in or are at least interested in pursuits of gathering data, interpretting data, creating data, using data to assess the capabilities of the software and systems that you design and build.

# The "Art" of sculpture

So, it's common knowledge that computers aren't magical devices; most computers do our bidding via CPUs that process binary instructions and data to follow our carefully coreographed script to its desired effect.

### Michael Angelo's statue of David

# The "Art" of programming

Programming is a lot like that. ;-)

> Every CD-ROM has program inside it and it is the task of the programmer to discover it.
[Jeremy Sellars](https://jeremy.sellars.us)

I think that's why we derive so much pleasure as we watch the CD-ROM spinning on the lathe in the work station and carefully take a chisel in hand and move it slowly to the right part of the surface of the disk and tap out the beautiful stream of the music in our minds.

# The media of programs

Of course not.  We use ~~carefully arranged vacuum tubes or transistors~~, ~~punch cards~~, symbolic instructions, assembly language, C-like languages to provide precise control over the hardware, Java-like languages to provide an abstraction over the hardware and a simpler memory model, SQL-like languages to provide declarative access to a simplified model of the data, etc..

Generally, each of these technologies "stand on the shoulders of giants" and endeavor to model the desired compuation or algorithm in a way that is less specific about the hardware or data representation, and more specific about the information of the system being modeled.

# Abstraction

> Being abstract is something profoundly different from being vague... The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.
